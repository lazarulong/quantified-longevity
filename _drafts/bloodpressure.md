## Blood pressure

I take my blood pressure always in the evening, after I get to bed with my Withing blood pressure monitor,
while sitting in the bed. I do this semi-regularly, about once a week, but I had periods where I did it 
nearly daily, but also longer gaps, for example due to holidays.

# Radicchio

I added radicchio into my diet about two years ago, mainly due to it being one of the best natural sources of 
lutelion [1], which in turn is known to inhibit the CD38 enzyme, which has number of positive downstream effects, 
including on NAD metabolism. I always use this variety, and add it to my salads:

I tend to eat salad about 4-7 times a week, but often it is difficult to get hold of radicchio in summer and
autumn month where I live, so there is some seasonality to when I eat it. 

In any case, quite surprisingly, radicchio came up as the most positive dietary association with my systolic 
blood pressure. This is surprising given that it is all over internet touted for its supposed blood pressure
reducing qualities, but the only study that the websites I checked were referring to (if anything at all) is this [2]. 
This study however doesn't actually talk about radicchio, but roasted chicory root, which is only related to radicchio in that 
radicchio is a particular variety of a cultivated chicory plant, but we eat the leafs not root, and of course
radicchio may have substantially different biochemical composition to the wild chicory plant.

With all this in mind, my blood pressure is in optimal range irrespective of the radicchio consumption, so I 
will be keeping it as a part of my diet for its other properties (see lutelion) for the time being, but I will keep
this in mind for future in case blood pressure would become an issue with advancing age.
