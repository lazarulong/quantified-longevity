# Endoluten

Endoluten is a peptide bioregulator that is derived from the pineal gland, which is located in the brain and is responsible for producing melatonin. The primary function of the pineal gland is to regulate circadian rhythms, which are the body's natural sleep-wake cycles, and to influence various hormonal functions.
