Several years ago, I realized that advancements in science had reached a point where, by engaging with and applying this knowledge personally, I could significantly increase my chances of extending my lifespan. This realization spurred me to seize the opportunity.

Quickly following this insight was the understanding that if I were to embark on this journey successfully, meticulously monitoring my progress and the effectiveness of various interventions on myself would be crucial. This led me to delve into the realms of aging science and the quantified-self movement.

About two years have now passed since I started to collect data in earnest, and I have refined my analytical tools enough to begin extracting valuable insights. As I embarked on this analysis and documented my findings, I recognized that with just a bit more effort, I could share these insights with others. Thus, this blog was born. Beyond disseminating my discoveries, my primary goal is to connect with others who are on similar paths, to share experiences, tools, and possibly even to pool data to hasten the generation of insights. I remain open-minded about where this journey will take me.

I this blog I plan to cover:
1. The correlations I uncover in my data, especially insights regarding the efficacy of the interventions I'm exploring, and any findings that may benefit others with similar objectives.
2. The array of hardware, software, and diagnostic tools I employ, along with the intricacies of the system I've developed to automate data collection and analysis. I hope that my experience will prove beneficial to others, or even inspire further enhancements.
3. Periodically, I might discuss significant developments in the fields of aging science and self-tracking technology.

# To Science or Not to Science

A disclaimer: my professional background is in a computational discipline focusing on the analysis of biological signals, but my work does not directly intersect with aging or self-tracking research. Nonetheless, I aim to apply my skills to the issues discussed in this blog and conduct my analyses with as much rigor as is feasible.

That said, it's crucial to acknowledge that the type of data I'm working withâ€”essentially, an N=1 experiment fraught with the subjective pitfalls of self-experimentationâ€”does not meet the standards of scientific rigor. Thus, it should not be interpreted as such.

Despite these limitations, I believe my efforts are - at least to me - valuable, and I'd like to explain why. The primary challenge of working with such limited, poorly controlled data is the risk of identifying false positivesâ€”detecting relationships that don't actually existâ€”unless one adheres to extremely strict significance criteria. However, I view this issue differently within the context of my personal journey, that I would from the point of view of advancement of scientific knowledge. I accept the possibility of false positives, which means I might undertake interventions believed to be effective that, in reality, are not. Yet, I don't see this as a significant problem as long as the majority of interventions I identify as beneficial truly are. The real concern would be inadvertently continuing harmful interventions, which seems unlikely since it's improbable that an intervention negatively affecting my health would present as strongly positive in my analyses. In simpler terms, I am comfortable with identifying a mix of truly and falsely beneficial interventions, provided that none of the wrongly identified interventions are actually harmful. I believe my approach, which I will detail further in upcoming blogs, will allow me to achieve this.

For those interested in more specifics (feel free to skip to the next blog if not ðŸ˜Š), consider that I am tracking over 300 variables about myself (more details in the next blog). This results in over 45,000 possible relationships to examine. Yet, with a maximum of about 1,000 readings for various tracked variables (and that only for those tracked daily) from the start of this project, applying a strict Bonferroni correction would make it nearly impossible to detect any relationships, regardless of their strength or validity. Therefore, I will not adhere to such stringent criteria for significance. Instead, I will focus on relatively strong relationships, disregard those with p-values barely below 0.01, and conduct additional ad-hoc tests to increase my confidence in validity of these relationships. I will also periodically reassess any interventions to identify potential false positives as more data are collected.
