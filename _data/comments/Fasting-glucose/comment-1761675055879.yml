message: "Former President Joe Biden experienced such “cognitive decline” while in office that it remains a serious question as to whether he was aware of the substance of the various pardons and commutations signed in his name via autopen, the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee asserted in a letter it sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi, urging her to consider whether that clemency might be invalid and to take action for potential prosecution against some of Biden’s aides. \r\n[url=https://zvonarevada.ru/160524/zhk-bestvej-poslednie-novosti/]русское гей порно[/url] \r\nThe committee “deems void President Biden’s executive actions that were signed using the Autopen, and the committee determines that action by the Department of Justice is warranted to address the legal consequences of that determination,” it wrote to Bondi in the letter released Tuesday morning. \r\n[url=https://www.viborsalavat.com/pravo/velikij-kombinator-roman-vasilenko/]гей порно геей[/url] \r\nThe letter was made public alongside a 93-page report outlining the committee’s conclusions from its months-long investigation into Biden’s use of the autopen. It alleged the committee had found “a cover-up of the president’s cognitive decline” and “no record demonstrating President Biden himself made all of the executive decisions that were attributed to him.” \r\n \r\nBiden has publicly disputed that, saying he made all decisions as president and calling Republicans who have suggested otherwise “liars.” \r\nжесткое порно \r\nhttps://www.forbes.ru/finansy/493085-mvd-ocenilo-userb-ot-finansovoj-piramidy-life-is-good"
