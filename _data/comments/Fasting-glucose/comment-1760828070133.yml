But doubt crept in. \r\n \r\n“It was never one light bulb moment. It was kind of a slow boiling over a few months,” Adamala, a synthetic biologist, said. People started asking questions, she added, “and we thought we can answer them, and then we realized we cannot.” \r\n \r\nThe questions hinged on what would happen if scientists succeeded in making a “mirror organism” such as a bacterium from molecules that are the mirror images of their natural forms. Could it inadvertently spread unchecked in the body or an environment, posing grave risks to human health and dire consequences for the planet? Or would it merely fizzle out and harmlessly disappear without a trace?"
