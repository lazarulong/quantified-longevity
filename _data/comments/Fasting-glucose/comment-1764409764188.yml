message: "Sears, once America’s largest and most important retailer, could very be going into its last Christmas shopping season. \r\n[url=https://at-kra43.cc]kra33 СЃСЃ[/url] \r\nThe Sears chain had 2,000 stores as recently as 20 years ago and more than 200 stores when it emerged from bankruptcy in 2019. Now it has just five, after three more closings this past year. \r\n[url=https://kra27-at.cc]kra45.СЃСЃ[/url] \r\nOne standalone store in Coral Gables, Florida, could be torn down to build 1,000 housing units. Another four operate in malls – in Braintree, Massachusetts; Concord, California; El Paso, Texas; and Orlando Florida. All those malls are owned by Simon Property Group, the nation’s largest mall operator. \r\n[url=https://kraken26-at.com]kra48.СЃСЃ[/url] \r\nThe company, once the Walmart and Amazon of its day, helped change America, from how people shopped to where they lived and more. Now the once-proud chain is in a precarious position; by next year’s holiday season, it could finally be gone. \r\nСЃСЃС‹Р»РєР° РЅР° РєСЂР°РєРµРЅ 2026 \r\nhttps://kraken6at.net"
