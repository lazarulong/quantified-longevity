message: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Russian attacks on the Ukrainian regions of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Sumy on Monday, saying that the Kremlin intends to “humiliate diplomatic efforts” just hours before European leaders visit the White House. \r\n[url=https://kra-42--at.ru]kra41[/url] \r\n“The Russian war machine continues to destroy lives despite everything,” Zelensky said in a statement, hours before he’s due to meet US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. “That is precisely why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the killings. That is why reliable security guarantees are required. That is why Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war.” \r\n[url=https://kra41-cc.com]kra36 cc[/url] \r\n“Everyone seeks dignified peace and true security,” the Ukrainian president said. “And at this very moment, the Russians are attacking Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, the Sumy region, and Odesa, destroying residential buildings and our civilian infrastructure.” \r\n \r\nAt least seven people were killed in Russia’s attack? on Kharkiv and a further three killed in the ballistic missile strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia, with scores more injured, according to Ukrainian authorities. \r\n \r\n“This was a demonstrative and cynical Russian strike,” Zelensky added. \r\nkra38 \r\nhttps://kra-41cc.com"
