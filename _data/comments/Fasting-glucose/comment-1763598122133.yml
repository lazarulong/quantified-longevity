message: "What we're covering \r\n[url=https://kpa46.cc]kra46[/url] \r\n• Epstein files: The Senate is officially sending the bill compelling the Department of Justice to release all of its case files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature. \r\n[url=https://kra46-at.net]kra46 cc[/url] \r\n• Trump expected to sign it: The president has said he’ll sign the bill and will do so “whenever it gets to the White House,” a senior administration official said. It’s unclear if the DOJ would release the files if the measure is signed or whether they will remain tied up in investigations. \r\n[url=https://kra46cc.net]kra46 СЃСЃ[/url] \r\n• Stark reversal: The speed with which the legislation moved through both chambers of Congress yesterday marked a stark reversal after months of Trump and GOP leaders working to quash it. \r\n \r\n• Meanwhile: After hosting Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman at the White House yesterday, Trump will make remarks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum today. \r\n \r\nkra46 cc \r\nhttps://kra-46-at.net"
