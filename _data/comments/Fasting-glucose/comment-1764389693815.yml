message: "More than $100,000 worth of escargots were stolen from a French snail farmer earlier this week, French media reported, leaving the supplier scrambling to replenish its stock in time for the holiday season. \r\n[url=https://kra58.net]кракен вход ссылки[/url] \r\n“This is really not the post that we thought we would write approaching the holidays,” L’Escargot Des Grands Crus wrote in a post on Facebook Tuesday. “We were victims of a burglary and our stock of fresh and frozen snails was stolen.” \r\n[url=https://kra59-cc.com]kra45 cc[/url] \r\nA family business, L’Escargot Des Grands Crus breeds around 350,000 snails annually, preparing the escargots “with the greatest care,” according to its website. \r\n[url=https://https-kra57.cc]kra26 at[/url] \r\nThe snail theft is “a shock, incomprehensible and a real blow for all of the team,” the farm, which is based in Bouzy, northeastern France, said on Facebook. \r\n \r\nOvernight from Sunday into Monday, thieves entered the farm undetected and broke into the buildings housing the snails, French public broadcaster France Info reported.
