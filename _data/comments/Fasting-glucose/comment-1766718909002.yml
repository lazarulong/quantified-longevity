message: "Pope Leo XIV celebrated the first Christmas since his election by denouncing the suffering of people of Gaza – taking shelter in tents from the “rain, wind and cold” – and by calling for the guns to fall silent in Ukraine. \r\n[url=https://mellstroycomcasino.com]mellstroy[/url] \r\nOn Christmas Day, the first US-born pope, offered the traditional “Urbi et Orbi” blessing (“To the City and to the World”) from the balcony of St Peter’s, surveying a world speckled with conflicts from Yemen to Myanmar, and calling for compassion towards those who have fled their homelands to seek a future in Europe and America. \r\n[url=https://mellstroy.social]mellstroy casino[/url] \r\nLeo, who was elected on May 8, said Thursday that Jesus Christ is “our peace” because he “shows us the way to overcome conflicts, whether interpersonal or international. With his grace, we can and must each day our part to reject hatred, violence and opposition, and to practice dialogue, peace and reconciliation.” \r\n[url=https://mellstro.com]mellstroy bonus[/url] \r\nThe pontiff began by asking for “justice, peace and stability” for Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Israel and Syria. Later, he said that, by becoming man, “Jesus took upon himself our fragility,” allowing him to identify “with those who have nothing left and have lost everything, like the inhabitants of Gaza.” \r\n \r\nLeo celebrates Christmas Holy Mass at the Vatican. \r\nLeo celebrates Christmas Holy Mass at the Vatican.

He quoted an Israeli poet, Yehuda Amichai, who called for peace to blossom “like wildflowers.” \r\n \r\nRelated article \r\nThe acting Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Pierbattista Pizzaballa attends a morning Mass at Saint Catherine's Church, in the Church of the Nativity, in Bethlehem, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank December 25, 2025.

In his first major interview in September, the American pope voiced concern over “some things” happening in the country of his birth, highlighting the significance of a letter his predecessor, Pope Francis, had sent to US bishops earlier this year, rebuking the administration’s deportation plans. \r\n \r\nРјРµР»СЃС‚СЂРѕР№ СЃСЃС‹Р»РєР° \r\nhttps://mellstroy.social"
