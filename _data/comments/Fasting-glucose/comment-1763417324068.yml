message: "Even the joy of Halloween will cost more this year, with less chocolate than in years past. \r\n[url=https://kraken2trfqodidvlh4aa337cpzfrhdlfldhve5nf7njhumwr7instadl.com]кракен тг ссылка[/url] \r\nExpect more packages of tangy gummies, riding off a meteoric high last year. Your kid’s trick-or-treat bag may be filled with a lot of pumpkin-spice-filled-anything. And like last year, cocoa bean industry experts are expecting high price tags to be passed down to consumers. \r\n[url=https://kraken2trfqodidvlh4a337cpzfrhdlfldhve5nf7njhumwr7instad-onion.com]kraken2trfqodidvlh4aa337cpzfrhdlfldhve5nf7njhumwr7instad onion[/url] \r\nAnd with high cocoa prices, every producer from specialty chocolate makers to candy giants are changing up how they sell their treats. For consumers, this could mean less chocolate per package, higher prices and less cocoa content – meaning less chocolate-y chocolate – compared to before. \r\n[url=https://kraken7jmgt7yhhe2c4iyilthnhcugfylcztsdhh7otrr6jgdw667pqdonion.net]kraken2trfqodidvlh4aa337cpzfrhdlfldhve5nf7njhumwr7instad onion[/url] \r\nOverall, candy is 10.8% more expensive this Halloween season than last year, according to an analysis of NielsenIQ data conducted by progressive think tank Groundwork Collaborative and shared first with CNN. That’s nearly quadruple the overall rate of inflation. \r\n[url=https://kraken7jmgt7yhhe2c4iyilthnhcugfylcztsdhh7otrr6jgdw667pqd.com]ссылка на кракен[/url] \r\nIn 2024, Halloween candy prices only rose 2.1%, the analysis found. \r\n \r\nHalloween spending is no fun-sized matter. Americans shelled out $7.4 billion in Halloween chocolate and candy sales in 2024, a 2.2% increase from 2023, the National Confectioners Association said. \r\nкракен актуальная ссылка \r\n \r\nhttps://kraken5af44k24fwzohe6fvqfgxfsee4lgydb3ayzkfhlzqhuwlo3ad.com"
