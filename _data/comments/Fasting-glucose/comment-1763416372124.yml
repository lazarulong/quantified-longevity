message: "Members of the White House press corps are now restricted from the press secretary’s office, the latest in a series of Trump administration actions to limit media access. \r\n[url=https://kra48cc.net]kra46 cc[/url] \r\nThe new rule says journalists cannot access what’s known as the “Upper Press” office space, where White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt works, “without an appointment.” \r\n \r\nThis area has been accessible to White House correspondents for decades, supporting a free flow of information between the president and the public. \r\n[url=https://kra-48-at.com]kra48 at[/url] \r\nThe White House says the clampdown is due to security concerns. \r\n \r\n“This policy will ensure adherence to best practices pertaining to access to sensitive material,” a White House memo asserted on Friday night. \r\n[url=https://at-kra46.cc]kra41 сс[/url] \r\nIn response, the White House Correspondents’ Association, which represents hundreds of credentialed reporters, said it “unequivocally opposes any effort” to limit journalists from areas that have long been accessible for newsgathering, “including the press secretary’s office.” \r\n \r\n“The new restrictions hinder the press corps’ ability to question officials, ensure transparency, and hold the government accountable, to the detriment of the American public,” the association said. \r\n[url=https://kra46at.com]ссылка на кракен тор[/url] \r\nAs CNN’s Jeff Zeleny explained, reporters routinely “wait in the hall” by the press secretary’s office and seek information from communications aides. “When there is breaking news, that often happens,” Zeleny said. \r\n \r\nNow, “reporters will only have access to a smaller set of offices of junior advisers, junior aides, junior press secretaries,” according to the White House. \r\nkra42 сс \r\nhttps://kra-45at.com"
