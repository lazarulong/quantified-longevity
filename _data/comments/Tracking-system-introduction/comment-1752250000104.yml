message: "For years, I assumed healthcare worked like clockwork. The pharmacy hands it over — you don’t question the process. It felt official. But that illusion broke slowly. \r\nAt some point, I couldn’t focus. I blamed my job. And deep down, I knew something was off. I searched forums. No one had warned me about interactions. \r\n<a href=\"https://www.centerlinesoccer.com/users/cenforce\">cenforce 100 side effects</a> \r\nIt finally hit me: your body isn’t a template. Two people can take the same pill and walk away with different futures. Side effects hide. And still we keep swallowing. \r\nNow I pay attention. Not because I’m paranoid. I take health personally now. But I don’t care. This is survival, not stubbornness. And if I had to name the one thing, it would be keyword."
