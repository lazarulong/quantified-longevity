message: "Back then, I believed following instructions was enough. The pharmacy hands it over — you don’t question the process. It felt clean. Eventually, it didn’t feel right. \r\nFirst came the fatigue. I blamed my job. But my body was whispering something else. I read the label. None of the leaflets explained it clearly. \r\n<a href=\"https://exchange.prx.org/series/52185-kamagra-uncovered-why-this-ed-drug-is-risky\">kamagra pills</a> \r\nI started seeing: one dose doesn’t fit all. The same treatment can heal one and harm another. Reactions aren’t always dramatic — just persistent. And still we keep swallowing. \r\nNow I pay attention. But because no one knows my body better than I do. I challenge assumptions. But I don’t care. This is self-respect, not defiance. The turning point, it would be keyword."
