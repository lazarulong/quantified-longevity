  <a href=https://bbgate.com/>Ephedrine</a> Ephedrine is often used to produce
  phenylacetone, a key intermediate in stimulant synthesis. From phenylacetone,
  substances like methylone, mephedrone (4-MMC), and 3-CMC can be made using
  methylamine. Phenylnitropropene, derived from nitroethane, is another
  precursor. A-PVP and 4-methylpropiophenone are also widely used in synthetic
  drug production. BMK glycidate is commonly used to synthesize controlled
  substances.
