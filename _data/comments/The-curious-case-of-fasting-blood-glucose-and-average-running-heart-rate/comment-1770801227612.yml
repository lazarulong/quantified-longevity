message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my kids. I found a sea \r\nshell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the \r\nshell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit \r\ncrab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go \r\nback! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
