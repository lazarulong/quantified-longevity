  The ending of the book is often described as ambiguous. Does Edna drown
  intentionally, or is she simply too tired to swim back? To hunt for clues, you
  need the text in front of you. A searchable awakening pdf is the best tool for
  this investigation. You can look back at earlier swimming scenes to see how
  her relationship with the water evolves. This kind of detective work is what
  makes literary analysis so fun. Join the debate by reading the evidence for
  yourself.
