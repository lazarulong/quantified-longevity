  The "grumpy x sunshine" trope is a fan favorite because it allows for so much
  character growth, and this book is a masterclass in it. Alex's cynicism is
  constantly challenged by Ava's hopefulness. If you are looking to expand your
  digital library, a Twisted Love PDF is a solid addition. The book explores the
  idea that opposites do not just attract; they complete each other. The secrets
  that are revealed in the latter half of the book add a layer of tragedy that
  deepens the connection between the characters. It is a rollercoaster of a
  novel that you won't want to get off.
