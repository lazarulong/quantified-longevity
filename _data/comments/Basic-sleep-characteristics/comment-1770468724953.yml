  Orwell's decision to use animals allows him to simplify complex political
  maneuvers without losing their impact. The sheep, with their bleating chants,
  represent the mindless mob that drowns out rational debate. If you are looking
  to analyze these symbols, downloading an Animal Farm PDF can be very helpful
  for study sessions. The book forces us to confront the uncomfortable reality
  that a population can be complicit in its own subjugation through ignorance or
  fear. https://animalfarmpdf.store/ Animal Farm Pdf Mr Clancy
