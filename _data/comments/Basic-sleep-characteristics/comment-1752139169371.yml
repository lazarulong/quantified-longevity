message: "Back then, I believed following instructions was enough. The system moves you along — you nod, take it, and move on. It felt official. Eventually, it didn’t feel right. \r\nThen the strange fog. I blamed my job. Still, my body kept rejecting the idea. I searched forums. The warnings were there — just buried in jargon. \r\n<a href=\"https://fnri.dost.gov.ph/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=90\">cialis 5mg</a> \r\nThat’s when I understood: one dose doesn’t fit all. Two people can take the same pill and walk away with different futures. Reactions aren’t always dramatic — just persistent. Still we trust too easily. \r\nNow I pay attention. But because no one knows my body better than I do. I track everything. But I don’t care. This is self-respect, not defiance. And if I had to name the one thing, it would be keyword."
